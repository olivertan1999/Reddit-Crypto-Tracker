# Introduction
With 3.3 mil members (as of now), [r/CryptoCurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/) has certainly garnered the interest of many retail investors and crypto enthusiasts. As such, this is the perfect platform to gauge the sentiment of retail investors in the market as well as to get a first hand information on what's the next up and coming coin.

The aim of this project is to create a **web-based dashboard** that showcases the overall sentiment in the comment section of the subreddit's Daily Discussion post and updates its data automatically **every 10 minutes**. This project is built under the dash framework and its backend consists of scraping the comments data via reddit's api called [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as well as scraping cryptocurrencies' data in [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/) via conventional web-scraping method.
